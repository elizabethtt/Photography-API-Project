# Photography-API-Project
This website, Lensation, lets users explore random high-quality images from the free API, Lorem Picsum. Users can view new images at the click of a button and apply filters like grayscale, blur, or both to customize the visual experience. The site provides an easy way to see the world from different perspectives through photography.
